# Elixir Function Of The Day

A simple website that displays one Elixir function docs per day.
Ecto and Phoenix included.

## TODO

 - [ ] IN PROGRESS: proper hexdocs links whenever possible
 - [x] ~~add a button/cookie that allows skipping daily seeding~~ enable random link
 - [ ] clean up phoenix boilerplate leftovers
 - [x] resolve the JS dependency alert :rage: 
 - [ ] setup CI
 - [ ] try to ensure *somewhat* deterministic function count, regardless of build env
 - [ ] return cache headers
 - [ ] fix crappy view on mobile
 - [ ] add "improve the docs!" button to fork & edit on github at least - the randomness reveails how some functions are under-documented
