# Elixir Function Of The Day

A simple website that displays one Elixir function docs per day.
Ecto and Phoenix included.

## TODO

 - [ ] proper hexdocs links whenever possible
 - [ ] add a button/cookie that allows skipping daily seeding
 - [ ] clean up phoenix boilerplate leftovers
 - [x] resolve the JS dependency alert :rage: 
 - [ ] setup CI
 - [ ] try to ensure *somewhat* deterministic function count, regardless of build env
 - [ ] return cache headers
